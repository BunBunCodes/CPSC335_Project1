A simple file reader that given schedules, finds openings for meetings written in Python

# How It Should Work

You should at least download the Project1_starter and the input.txt. All the data you want sorted should go into input.txt and even if you don't have an output.txt, the program will write it for you.

# Limitations

Unfortunately during the course of coding this project I ended up breaking the code somehow, and it doesn't work as intended.
